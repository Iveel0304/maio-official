# Fixes Applied to Maio Official Application

This document outlines all the issues found in the error logs and their corresponding fixes.

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. UUID undefined errors (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** DELETE requests were sending `undefined` instead of valid UUIDs for media, events, and sponsors endpoints.
**Root Cause:** Admin components were using `_id` (MongoDB style) but the database uses `id` (PostgreSQL/Supabase style).

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/admin/EventsManager.tsx`
- `src/components/admin/MediaManager.tsx` 
- `src/components/admin/SponsorsManager.tsx`
- `src/components/admin/ResultsManager.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Changed all `_id` references to `id` in interfaces
- Updated all delete operations to use `item.id` instead of `item._id`
- Fixed navigation links to use correct ID field

### 2. Missing 'rankings' column in results table (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** POST /api/results failed with "Could not find the 'rankings' column of 'results' in the schema cache"
**Root Cause:** Database table was missing the rankings column.

**Fix:** Added `rankings JSONB` column to results table in database migration.

### 3. Missing 'author' column in articles table (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** POST /api/news failed with "Could not find the 'author' column of 'articles' in the schema cache"
**Root Cause:** Database table was missing the author column.

**Fix:** Added `author TEXT` column to articles table in database migration.

### 4. Sponsors tier check constraint violation (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** Sponsor creation failed with tier check constraint violation.
**Root Cause:** Database constraint was too restrictive or column was missing.

**Fix:** 
- Added `tier` column if missing
- Created proper constraint allowing values: 'organizer', 'main', 'sponsor', 'supporter'

### 5. Database schema inconsistencies (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** Various columns missing between frontend expectations and database schema.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added `summary JSONB` column to articles table
- Added `participants INTEGER` column to events table  
- Fixed `location` column in events table to be JSONB for multilingual support
- Added proper indexes for performance

## Database Migration Applied

A comprehensive database migration script was created: `database-fixes.sql`

### Key Changes:
1. **Results Table:** Added `rankings JSONB` column
2. **Articles Table:** Added `author TEXT` and `summary JSONB` columns  
3. **Sponsors Table:** Added `tier TEXT` column with constraint
4. **Events Table:** 
   - Fixed `location` to be JSONB
   - Added `participants INTEGER` column
5. **Indexes:** Added performance indexes for new columns

## How to Apply the Fixes

### 1. Frontend Fixes (Already Applied)
The frontend components have been updated to use the correct field names and handle UUIDs properly.

### 2. Database Migration (Needs to be run)
Run the SQL migration script in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Run the contents of database-fixes.sql in your Supabase SQL Editor
```

### 3. Verification
After applying the database migration:

1. Test article creation (POST /api/news)
2. Test result creation (POST /api/results) 
3. Test sponsor creation (POST /api/sponsors)
4. Test delete operations for all entities
5. Test event creation with multilingual location

## Error Log Analysis

### Original Errors:
```
DELETE /api/media/undefined - invalid input syntax for type uuid: "undefined"
DELETE /api/events/undefined - invalid input syntax for type uuid: "undefined" 
DELETE /api/sponsors/undefined - invalid input syntax for type uuid: "undefined"
POST /api/results - Could not find the 'rankings' column
POST /api/sponsors - violates check constraint "sponsors_tier_check"
POST /api/news - Could not find the 'author' column
```

### After Fixes:
- ✅ DELETE operations use proper UUIDs
- ✅ All required columns exist in database
- ✅ Constraints are properly defined
- ✅ Multilingual support is consistent

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create Test Data:** Try creating entries for each entity type
2. **Delete Test Data:** Verify delete operations work properly  
3. **Check Multilingual:** Ensure English/Mongolian content saves correctly
4. **Verify Constraints:** Test tier values for sponsors
5. **Performance Test:** Check that new indexes improve query performance

## Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- UUID fields are now handled consistently
- Multilingual support is standardized using JSONB
- Database constraints prevent invalid data
- Proper indexes added for performance

The application should now run without the reported errors. If any new issues arise, they should be logged and addressed following the same systematic approach.
