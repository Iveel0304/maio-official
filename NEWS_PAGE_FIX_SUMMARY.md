# News Page MongoDB Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. MongoDB Data Duplication Issue
**Problem**: The server was continuously receiving the same data with values like `{ articles: 2, events: 2, media: 2, results: 1, sponsors: 2 }` because of duplicate data insertion on every server restart.

**Root Cause**: 
- Server initialization was running every time without checking existing data properly
- No cleanup mechanism for duplicate data
- Race conditions in data fetching

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added proper data existence checking before insertion
- ✅ Improved initialization logic to only insert sample data when collections are completely empty
- ✅ Added cleanup endpoints (`/api/cleanup`) to remove duplicate data
- ✅ Added collection statistics endpoint (`/api/stats`) for monitoring

### 2. News Page Data Fetching Issues
**Problem**: 
- Continuous API calls and state updates
- Memory leaks from unmounted components
- Inconsistent data loading

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added proper component cleanup with mounted flag
- ✅ Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Better API response handling
- ✅ Reduced unnecessary re-renders

### 3. Server Performance and Stability
**Problem**: 
- Multiple server instances running simultaneously
- Port conflicts and connection issues
- No graceful shutdown handling

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added automatic port detection and assignment
- ✅ Improved cleanup script to kill existing processes
- ✅ Better error handling and logging
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling

## API Endpoints Working Correctly

### News API
- `GET /api/news` - Get all articles with pagination and filters
- `GET /api/news?featured=true&limit=1` - Get featured articles
- `GET /api/news/:id` - Get single article
- `POST /api/news` - Create new article
- `PUT /api/news/:id` - Update article
- `DELETE /api/news/:id` - Delete article
- `GET /api/news/categories` - Get article categories

### Data Management
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/stats` - Collection statistics
- `POST /api/cleanup` - Remove duplicate data
